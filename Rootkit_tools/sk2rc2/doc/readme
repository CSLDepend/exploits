so, ladies and gantlemans, there we are. result of 2 year development in
kernel intrusion: suckit2-first release candidate. however, because sk is
that wanted kind of malware, i'll give only _signed_ copies to trusted
people - that means, each user will have sk with id in it, and if that
copy will be leaked, i'll have idea who does. if you're skilled enough
to crack the binary and remove the id - which is not much that hard,
then you're probably inteligent enough to do not leak it, even better
write better binary protection stuff and contact me ;-p

about source codes - those will be given to interested coders, i.e.
to people who can _prove_ it, not for removing banners and analysis
of techniques for developing anti-* tools, nor ripping the code to
be used somewhere else. and keep in the mind: this is alfa version
which will requiere a lot of testing, *do not get caught with it*,
use strong passwords and again: do not give it to someone else,
if your friend really can't live w/o suckit anymore, point him to me.
why all of that ? cause i think that sk2 is nice piece of software,
and it's quite complicated - i spent a lotta of hours on it - to be
simply leaked to public with sources, see:

devastace:~/sk2# cat `find elfuck/ src/ include/ -name "*.[chS]"` | wc
   9510   27692  193611

deal with it.

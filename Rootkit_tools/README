Hacker Defender V1.0.0 
	Hacker Defender was a very common rootkit in the wild. It sports a user friendly inifile that controls its behaviour. It is 98% userland rootkit and some source-code is available. There are also commercial versions of Hacker Defender that brings new functionality together with protection against antivirus products and rootkit detectors.

migbot
	 migbot rootkit example

suckit2priv.tar.gz 
	SucKIT Rootkit v2.0-devel-rc2. Easy-to-use, Linux-i386 kernel-based rootkit. The code stays in memory through /dev/kmem trick, without help of LKM support nor System.map or such things. Everything is done on the fly. It can hide PIDs, files, tcp/udp/raw sockets and sniff TTYs.

Morphine V2.7 
	Morphine is very unique application for PE files encryption. Unlike other PE encryptors and compressors Morphine includes own PE loader which enables it to put whole source image to the .text section of new PE file. This one is very powerful because you can compress source file with your favourite compressor like UPX and then encrypt its output with Morphine. Another powerful thing here is polymorphic engine which always creates absolutely different decryptor for the new PE file. This mean if your favourite trojan horse is detected by an antivirus you can encrypt it with Morphine. You will not get the virus alert again.

SInAR-0.3.tar 
	SInAR Solaris rootkit version 0.3. Invisible kernel based rootkit for Solaris 8, 9, and 10. Special TAX release.

enyelkm-1.3-no-objs 
	LKM rootkit for Linux x86 with the 2.6 kernel. It inserts salts inside system_call and sysenter_entry handlers, so it does not modify sys_call_table, or IDT content. It hide files, directories, and processes. Hides chunks inside of files, gives remote reverse_shell access, local root, etc.

phalanx-b6.tar 
	Phalanx is a self-injecting kernel rootkit designed for the Linux 2.6 branch that does not use the now-disabled /dev/kmem device. Features include file hiding, process hiding, socket hiding, a tty sniffer, a tty connectback-backdoor, and auto injection on boot.

pingrootkit.tar 
	Ping Rootkit executes a root shell by simply executing the well known and "trusted" command with a special argument and a password. Includes the full source code for ping as well as the patch.

ssheater-1.1.tar.gz 
	SSHeater is a program that infects the OpenSSH daemon in run-time in order to log all future sessions and implement a backdoor where a single password, chosen by the user, can log into all accounts in the system. Theres a log parser included in the package that can display authentication information about sessions as well as play the session just like TTYrec/play.

NtIllusion V1.0 
	A portable Win32 userland rootkit. NtIllusion is an userland rootkit for win 2000/XP systems. It uses Dll injection and API entry point rewriting to perform its stealth. This is more a proof of concept than a true hax0r tool.

override.tar.bz 
	The override Rootkit: A LKM Linux 2.6 rootkit that uses patched systemcalls. Features - Hides pids and automatically hides the pids of child processes - Hides network ports - Hides files which begin with a user-defined prefix - Can show the hidden pids.

NIAP Anti Rootkit Tools 
	In these tools, we use some new tech called mirror system (pretty cool, we hope it worth the name ;p). We mirrored the kernel file, file system driver file, and it can do more. We think the effect is that there will be no more hook(code hook, not include data hook, like NDIS or registry hive hook, for now). Maybe hook is end of the road. RUK is powerful, but we dontt need to restore the hooked code and the FSD filter also is not a problem, that may lower the risk. We think its a more stable method, all the system call from the tools through an privacy copy of kernel, of cource the runtime kernel data still the same :>

logginsh.txt 
	loggin.sh is a script written to emulate a Linux login prompt and then record the logins to /tmp/.dump.

AFX Rootkit 2005 
	This OPEN SOURCE Delphi rootkit uses code injection and hooks Windows native API to hide processes, modules, handles, files, ports, registry keys, etc.

silentdoor.tar.gz

Page Frame Number belongs.
